# Contributing
First of all, thanks for your interest in contributing to this project.

I am open to contributions, and I will be happy to accept any pull request that meets the needs of this module.  You can also open an issue, and I will be happy to help you out, or even add a new feature.

### Why does this project exist?
First I created [sns-payload-validator](https://github.com/devinstewart/sns-payload-validator), you can read why [here](https://github.com/devinstewart/sns-payload-validator/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md). While this works great, I wanted to create a [hapi](https://hapi.dev/) plugin that would do all of the work.

I also wanted a solution that would allow me to set different routes for different topics.

### Coding Style
I have adapted the coding style guide of [hapijs](https://hapi.dev/policies/styleguide/), as I do work with the fine folks in that project.

### Dependencies
As a DevSecOps engineer, I love modules without a lot of dependencies. If there is a feature that you would like to add that requires a dependency, please open an issue.  We will come to one of three decisions:
- We add the dependency.
- We include the funtionality needed in the module.
- We create a separate module maintained here that includes the functionality needed.

### Conclusion
I hope that this module is useful to you, and I hope that you will contribute to the project. -- Devin Stewart
